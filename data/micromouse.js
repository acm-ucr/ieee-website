Here at UCR, we host Micromouse workshops which teach Arduino, basic C programming, soldering, and how to use all the parts that are needed to build a Micromouse. Micromouse is a beginner project, so it is open to everyone, regardless of experience or major, and we encourage anyone who is interested to join!",
